# File_Handling_In_Secondary_Storage
Greetings Beta Tester, 

 I hope you're doing great , I'm good thanks ^_^

It's only a simple remark. I want to tell you that I didn't use any plagiarism source concerning my code, on the contrary I used several inspiration sources that helped me to realize this code such as The C bible and so on and I have my copyright on it XD (even if other people would do otherwise) 


Copyright : Djermoune Amayes 

PS : I even implemented the function of displaying the file in a sequential way as well as the filling of the file because I forgot to check these details in the official report but well in the code you will find what you asked, implemented !


on those Enjoy !  ^_^
